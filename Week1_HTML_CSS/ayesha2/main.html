        <h4>My limited experience in a teaching organisation helped me gauge my skills. Due to COVID-19, my academic timelines were impacted owing to restrictions and I took up this opportunity. My work ethic & attitude helped me with a successful tenure at my previous organisation. My dedication & methods were highly appreciated by my clients. 
            However, I realised my true passion resides in contributing towards technological advancements using my skills. Versatility, self-motivation, hard work and continuous learning are my superior personal strengths that have helped me succeed. Change is the only constant and hence I am now seeking the next challenge that resonates with my ideas for continued personal development and professional advancement. I have proven to be an extraordinary performer and I aspire to perform to my fullest potential to make the most of this opportunity.
