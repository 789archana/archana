Create database schema of the Task Manager to manage the tasks, activities, and comments of the application users. The Task Manager application built using this database design can be used to store the tasks associated with the users. The same application can be used to manage the task activities and comments or notes.
Schema needs to support a wide range of characters so use CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 while creating schema.

Tables List:
	user
	task
	task_meta
	tag
